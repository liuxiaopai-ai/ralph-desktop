# Ralph Desktop

**Start vague. Ralph Loop until perfect.**

A visual controller for AI coding agents that helps you brainstorm requirements and execute tasks through persistent iteration.

## Why Ralph Desktop?

### The Problem

Using AI coding agents like Claude Code or Codex can be frustrating:

| Pain Point | What Happens |
|------------|--------------|
| **"I don't know how to write prompts"** | You give vague instructions, AI produces garbage |
| **"AI runs once and stops"** | You manually retry over and over, hoping for better results |
| **"Setting up Ralph Loop is hard"** | The methodology exists, but configuring bash while loops and managing state is tedious for newcomers |

### The Solution

Ralph Desktop solves all three:

1. **AI Brainstorm** — Don't write prompts. Just describe your vague idea, and AI will interview you to clarify requirements and generate a high-quality prompt automatically.

2. **Ralph Loop Execution** — One click to start, then AI iterates autonomously until the task is complete or hits your configured limit.

3. **Visual Control** — Real-time logs, pause/resume/stop anytime. You're always in control.

## What is Ralph Loop?

**Ralph Loop** is an AI coding methodology introduced by [Geoffrey Huntley](https://ghuntley.com/). Named after Ralph Wiggum from *The Simpsons* — a character who seems simple but persists relentlessly — the approach embodies "brute-force elegance."

### How It Works

Instead of running an AI agent once and hoping for the best, Ralph Loop:

1. **Iterates continuously** — The AI executes, reviews its own output, fixes mistakes, and repeats
2. **Uses fresh context each iteration** — Avoids "context rot" by treating each loop as a new conversation with the spec as source of truth
3. **Stops on completion signal** — Detects when the task is truly done (via `<done>COMPLETE</done>` or similar markers)

### Why It's Effective

- **Quantity breeds quality** — Like Monte Carlo tree search, many attempts find better solutions
- **Self-correction** — AI catches and fixes its own errors over multiple passes
- **Works for complex tasks** — Breaks down large problems that exceed a single context window

> *"Dumb loop. Smart results."*

```

1. **Describe** — Start with a vague idea. No need for perfect prompts.
2. **Brainstorm** — AI interviews you through Socratic dialogue, then generates a detailed task specification.
3. **Loop** — Click "Start" and Ralph Loop takes over, iterating until the task is complete.
4. **Control** — Monitor progress in real-time. Pause, resume, or stop at any point.

## Supported CLIs

Ralph Desktop works with any AI coding CLI that supports headless execution:

| CLI | Status | Installation |
|-----|--------|--------------|
| [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) | ✅ Supported | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |
| [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) | ✅ Supported | `npm install -g @openai/codex` |
| [OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode) | ✅ Supported | `npm install -g opencode-ai` |

**Prerequisites:** You must have at least one of the above CLIs installed before using Ralph Desktop. If it already works in your terminal, Ralph Desktop will reuse its existing config automatically.
